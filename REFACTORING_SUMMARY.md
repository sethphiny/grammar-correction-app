# LLMGrammarChecker Refactoring Summary

## Overview
Successfully refactored the `LLMGrammarChecker` class in `/backend/services/llm_grammar_checker.py` to improve async handling, error resilience, token management, and overall code quality.

## Changes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Structured Logging
**Issue**: Used print statements throughout the code
**Fix**: 
- Replaced all `print()` calls with Python's `logging` module
- Added proper log levels: `logger.info()`, `logger.warning()`, `logger.error()`, `logger.debug()`
- Included `exc_info=True` for error logging to capture full stack traces

### ✅ 2. Tokenizer Model Mismatch
**Issue**: Hardcoded `"gpt-4o-mini"` when initializing tiktoken encoding
**Fix**:
- Changed line 86 to use `self.model` instead of hardcoded model name
- Added fallback to `cl100k_base` encoding if model not found in tiktoken
- Improved error handling with try-except block

### ✅ 3. Context Window Safety
**Issue**: No validation that prompt + response tokens fit within model limits
**Fix**:
- Added `MODEL_CONTEXT_WINDOWS` class constant with token limits for each model
- Implemented `_check_token_limit()` method to validate token usage
- Added pre-flight check before making API calls (line 455-459)
- Logs warning if token limit would be exceeded

### ✅ 4. JSON Repair
**Issue**: Used fragile regex-based JSON repair that could fail
**Fix**:
- Added `json-repair` library to `requirements.txt`
- Implemented robust `_repair_json()` method that:
  - Tries standard `json.loads()` first
  - Falls back to `json_repair` library if available
  - Uses markdown block removal as final fallback
  - Properly handles ImportError if library not installed

### ✅ 5. Paragraph Joining
**Issue**: Used `' '.join()` which removed line breaks
**Fix**:
- Changed lines 631 and 641 to use `'\n'.join()` instead
- Preserves original line breaks in paragraphs for better context
- Maintains document structure in LLM prompts

### ✅ 6. Fuzzy Matching for Hallucination Detection
**Issue**: Used word overlap percentage which was less accurate
**Fix**:
- Implemented `_fuzzy_match_ratio()` method using `SequenceMatcher` from difflib
- Returns similarity ratio (0.0-1.0) between two strings
- Updated hallucination detection (lines 534-542) to use fuzzy matching
- Changed threshold from 70% word overlap to 60% sequence similarity

### ✅ 7. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff
**Issue**: No retry mechanism for transient API errors
**Fix**:
- Added retry configuration constants: `MAX_RETRIES`, `INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY`, `MAX_RETRY_DELAY`
- Implemented `_call_llm_with_retry()` async method with:
  - Exponential backoff (doubles delay each retry, max 10s)
  - Specific handling for `RateLimitError`, `APITimeoutError`
  - Proper exception propagation after max retries
  - Structured logging of retry attempts

### ✅ 8. Progress Callback Sync/Async Support
**Issue**: Only supported async callbacks
**Fix**:
- Implemented `_call_with_progress()` method that:
  - Checks if callback is async using `inspect.iscoroutinefunction()`
  - Awaits async callbacks directly
  - Runs sync callbacks in executor to avoid blocking event loop
  - Gracefully handles callback errors without crashing main flow
- Updated line 674-679 to use new helper method

### ✅ 9. Client Cleanup/Context Management
**Issue**: No proper cleanup of AsyncOpenAI client
**Fix**:
- Added `cleanup()` async method to properly close client
- Includes error handling for cleanup failures
- Can be called manually or used with context managers

### ✅ 10. Improved Error Handling
**Additional improvements made:**
- Import OpenAI exception types: `APIError`, `RateLimitError`, `APITimeoutError`
- Better exception handling with specific error types
- Added `exc_info=True` to error logs for full stack traces
- Graceful degradation when optional dependencies missing

### ✅ 11. Type Hints
**Additional improvements made:**
- Added `Union` import for better type hints
- Improved type annotations throughout
- Better documentation in docstrings

## Dependencies Added
```txt
json-repair>=0.25.0
```

## Usage Notes

### Installing New Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Cleanup Example
```python
checker = LLMGrammarChecker()
try:
    # Use the checker
    issues, metadata = await checker.check_document(doc)
finally:
    # Clean up resources
    await checker.cleanup()
```

### Progress Callback Examples
```python
# Async callback
async def async_progress(current, total, issues):
    print(f"Progress: {current}/{total}, Issues: {issues}")

# Sync callback (now supported!)
def sync_progress(current, total, issues):
    print(f"Progress: {current}/{total}, Issues: {issues}")

# Both work!
await checker.check_document(doc, progress_callback=async_progress)
await checker.check_document(doc, progress_callback=sync_progress)
```

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
**None** - All changes are backward compatible

### Behavioral Changes
1. **Line breaks preserved**: Paragraphs now maintain original line breaks
2. **Better hallucination detection**: May filter out slightly different false positives
3. **Retry behavior**: API calls now retry on rate limits/timeouts (improves reliability)
4. **Logging**: Output moved from stdout to logging system (configure logging to see output)

### Configuration
To see logs, configure logging in your application:
```python
import logging

# Basic configuration
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Or more detailed
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s'
)
```

## Performance Improvements

1. **Fewer API failures**: Retry logic reduces transient errors
2. **Better token management**: Prevents wasted API calls that would fail
3. **Non-blocking progress**: Sync callbacks run in executor
4. **Faster JSON parsing**: json-repair library is more efficient than regex

## Code Quality Improvements

1. **Maintainability**: Structured logging easier to debug
2. **Testability**: Helper methods can be unit tested
3. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and retries
4. **Documentation**: Improved docstrings and comments
5. **Type Safety**: Better type hints throughout

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test retry logic**: Simulate rate limit errors
2. **Test token limits**: Use very large documents
3. **Test JSON repair**: Send malformed JSON responses
4. **Test sync callbacks**: Verify non-blocking behavior
5. **Test cleanup**: Ensure proper resource cleanup

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Metrics**: Add prometheus/statsd metrics for monitoring
2. **Caching**: Cache tokenizer instances across multiple checker instances
3. **Circuit breaker**: Add circuit breaker pattern for API failures
4. **Batch processing**: Process multiple paragraphs in parallel
5. **Streaming**: Support streaming responses for real-time feedback
