Recommendation: START HERE ‚≠ê
```

**What it does:**
- Only enhances 20-30% of issues
- Focuses on complex/uncertain corrections
- Skips high-confidence pattern matches

**Cost per 1MB doc:** $0.01-0.03

---

### Strategy 2: Smart Batching (Efficiency)
```
Cost Savings: 40-50% vs individual calls
Quality Impact: Same as non-batched
Implementation: Group 10-20 issues per API call
Recommendation: IMPLEMENT AFTER PHASE 3
```

**What it does:**
- Processes multiple issues in one API call
- Reduces API overhead
- Faster overall processing

**Cost per 1MB doc:** $0.02-0.04
