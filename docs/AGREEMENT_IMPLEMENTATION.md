## 🎯 Design Philosophy

### Conservative Approach
The patterns are intentionally conservative to **avoid false positives**. The implementation:

- ✅ **Catches obvious errors**: Common mistakes that are unambiguous
- ✅ **Avoids complex grammar**: No checking of modals, auxiliaries, or causative verbs
- ✅ **Context-aware**: Some patterns require specific context words to reduce false positives

### Excluded Cases (To Avoid False Positives)

These grammatically correct constructions are NOT flagged:

```
✅ "Would it feel good?"       # Modal - takes base form
✅ "Did it go well?"            # Auxiliary - takes base form
✅ "Let him go."                # Causative - takes bare infinitive
✅ "Make it work."              # Causative - correct
✅ "Does he like it?"           # Question form - correct
```

## 🔧 Integration

The agreement category is:
- ✅ Defined in `self.categories`
- ✅ Has 9 active patterns
- ✅ Integrated into checking logic
- ✅ Can be enabled/disabled via `enabled_categories` parameter
- ✅ Fully tested and working

---

## 📊 Confidence Score

Agreement issues are assigned a **confidence of 0.85** (85%) - high confidence because patterns are conservative and well-tested.

---

## 🎓 Usage

Users can now enable/disable agreement checking:

```python
# Check only agreement
issues, _ = await checker.check_document(
    document, 
    enabled_categories=['agreement']
)

# Check all categories including agreement
issues, _ = await checker.check_document(
    document, 
    enabled_categories=None  # None = all categories
)
```

## ✅ Status: PRODUCTION READY

The agreement category is fully implemented, tested, and ready for production use.
