# Changelog

All notable changes to the Grammar Correction App will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.0] - 2024-01-XX

### Added
- **Preserve Empty Lines for Accurate Line Numbers**: Document parser now preserves empty lines
  - Empty lines are included in the parsed document data to maintain accurate line numbering
  - Line numbers in reports now match the original document exactly
  - Makes it easier to locate issues in the original file
  - Empty lines are still skipped during grammar checking (no false errors)

### Changed
- **Simplified Grammar Checker to Focus on Clarity**: Temporarily disabled LanguageTool checks
  - Removed LanguageTool dependency from active checking
  - Now checks for redundant phrases, awkward phrasing, punctuation, and grammar using custom pattern matching
  - **Redundant Phrases**: 100+ common redundancies with corrections
    - Examples: "absolutely essential" â†’ "essential", "past history" â†’ "history", "end result" â†’ "result"
  - **Awkward Phrasing**: 100+ wordy/awkward constructions with clearer alternatives
    - Examples: "due to the fact that" â†’ "because", "at this point in time" â†’ "now", "in the event that" â†’ "if"
    - Examples: "has the ability to" â†’ "can", "made a decision" â†’ "decided", "prior to" â†’ "before"
  - **Punctuation**: Common punctuation errors
    - Multiple consecutive spaces â†’ single space
    - Extra spaces before punctuation (commas, semicolons, etc.)
    - Missing spaces after punctuation  
    - Multiple punctuation marks (e.g., ",," â†’ "," or ";;" â†’ ";")
    - Extra spaces after opening brackets or before closing brackets
    - **Note**: Ellipsis (...) and em dashes (â€”) are preserved as valid punctuation
  - **Grammar**: Common grammar errors
    - Common verb errors: "should of" â†’ "should have", "could of" â†’ "could have", "would of" â†’ "would have"
    - Homophones: "your/you're", "its/it's", "their/there", "then/than", "loose/lose", "affect/effect"
    - Double negatives (e.g., "don't have nothing" â†’ "don't have anything")
    - **Notes**: 
      - Article checking ("a" vs "an") removed - depends on pronunciation, not spelling
      - Subject-verb agreement removed - too complex (modals, auxiliaries, causatives all affect verb form)
  - Preserves capitalization of original text in suggestions
  - More focused and faster checking - other checks (spelling) will be added back later
  - Simplified codebase by removing unused LanguageTool processing methods

The grammar checker now intelligently distinguishes between contractions and possessives, preventing false positives on noun contractions.
  - Enhanced `_is_part_of_contraction()` method to handle noun + 's patterns
  - Distinguishes between contractions (noun + 's = "is") and possessives (noun + 's)
  - Uses context analysis: if next word is adjective/verb/adverb â†’ contraction, if noun â†’ possessive

  - Tested with 13+ patterns including "part's broken", "car's running", "dog's tail", "John's car"
  - All contraction and possessive test cases now pass with 100% accuracy

  - Comprehensive test coverage for 25+ contraction patterns including "it's", "he's", "she's", "we're", "they're", "I'm", "I've", "I'll", etc.
  - All contraction tests now pass with 100% success rate

### Added
- **Spelling Error Corrected Sentences**: Enhanced spelling error detection to show the full corrected sentence after applying the suggested fix. When a spelling error is detected, the report now displays both the suggested fix and the complete sentence with the correction applied, making it easier for users to see the context and understand the improvement.
  - Backend: Added `corrected_sentence` field to GrammarIssue schema and updated hybrid grammar checker to generate corrected sentences for spelling errors
  - Frontend: Updated IssuesPreview component to display corrected sentences in the UI with a distinct blue background for easy identification
- **Passive-to-Active Voice Conversion**: Implemented automatic conversion of passive voice sentences to active voice. When passive voice is detected, the system now provides a corrected sentence showing how to rewrite it in active voice for better clarity and engagement.
  - Backend: Added `convert_passive_to_active()` function that uses spaCy NLP parsing to identify passive constructions and automatically generate active voice alternatives
  - Enhanced passive voice detection to properly identify VBN verbs with auxpass dependencies
  - Updated grammar checker to include corrected sentences for passive voice issues

  - Enhanced sentence reconstruction to preserve complex sentence structure while converting passive to active voice
  - Fixed pronoun handling to properly replace pronouns (it, this, that) with appropriate subjects in active voice
  - Improved sentence span detection to correctly identify and replace passive constructions
- **Tense Consistency Corrections**: Enhanced tense consistency checking to provide corrected sentences showing how to fix tense inconsistencies. The system now automatically converts all verbs in a sentence to the same tense (present or past) based on the most common tense used.
  - Backend: Added `fix_tense_consistency()` function with comprehensive irregular verb handling and proper verb conjugation rules
  - Updated tense consistency detection to generate corrected sentences with consistent verb tenses
  - Added support for 100+ irregular verbs with proper present/past tense conversions
- **Style and Clarity Corrections**: Implemented automatic correction for common style and clarity issues including "a" vs "an" usage and redundant phrase simplification.
  - Backend: Added `fix_style_clarity()` function and `_check_style_clarity()` method
  - Detects and corrects "a" vs "an" issues before vowel sounds
  - Identifies and simplifies redundant phrases (e.g., "in order to" â†’ "to", "due to the fact that" â†’ "because")
  - Generates corrected sentences showing improved style and clarity
- **Confidence Threshold Filtering**: Added configurable confidence threshold to filter out low-confidence grammar issues. Only issues with 80%+ confidence are now flagged by default, reducing false positives and improving accuracy.
  - Backend: Added `confidence_threshold` parameter to HybridGrammarChecker (default: 0.8)
  - Implemented `_filter_by_confidence()` method to filter issues based on confidence scores
  - Updated grammar checking pipeline to apply confidence filtering after issue detection
- **Enhanced Passive Voice Conversion**: Improved passive-to-active voice conversion to handle complex sentences with negation and better verb conjugation.
  - Fixed negation handling in passive voice conversion (e.g., "was not created" â†’ "did not create")
  - Improved verb conjugation for irregular verbs in passive constructions
  - Enhanced sentence structure preservation during passive-to-active conversion

### Fixed
- **Frontend Compilation Error**: Fixed missing App.tsx component that was causing "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './App'" compilation error. Created comprehensive App component that integrates all existing components (Header, Footer, FileUpload, IssuesPreview) with proper state management, API integration, and user interface flow.
- **DOCX Parsing Regex Error**: Fixed "look-behind requires fixed-width pattern" error in document parser by replacing problematic regex with variable-width look-behind assertions with a more robust manual sentence boundary detection algorithm. The new approach properly handles abbreviations (Dr., Mr., Mrs., etc.) without regex limitations.
- **404 Errors for Web Assets**: Added favicon.ico and manifest.json files to prevent 404 errors in server logs. Created a custom favicon with "GC" branding and a proper web app manifest for better PWA support.
- **spaCy and LanguageTool Freezing**: Added comprehensive text sanitization to prevent spaCy and LanguageTool from freezing or misbehaving with .docx files containing problematic characters. The sanitization removes zero-width spaces, control characters, normalizes whitespace, and handles curly quotes/dashes that commonly cause issues in document processing.
